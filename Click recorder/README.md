This is a React web application which inserts a circle when you click on it, it also has two buttons one to undo the click and another one to redo the click in case we used the first button.

# Hi, I'm Gabriel! 👋

I am a thirty-three-year-old Brazilian leaving the automotive industry behind and transitioning into tech. I have a beautiful relationship with feedback, that's how I've learned how to speak English, asking to be corrected every time I made a mistake. It helped me with English, and I believe this will also help me in the tech industry! 

If I'm not coding I'll probably be working out, gaming, discovering the British countryside, or just outside watching birds!
